    "blurb": "The COMT gene, or catechol-O-methyltransferase gene, plays a crucial role in the breakdown of certain neurotransmitters, like dopamine and norepinephrine, in the brain. It's responsible for producing the COMT enzyme, which helps regulate the levels of these neurotransmitters. Variations in the COMT gene can influence an individual's cognitive function, stress response, and susceptibility to certain mental health conditions.",

        "blurb": "The COMT V158M variation is a genetic polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene. This variation results in an amino acid change from valine to methionine at position 158 of the COMT enzyme, which is involved in the breakdown of catecholamines, such as dopamine and norepinephrine.\n\nThe significance of this variation lies in its impact on COMT enzyme activity. Individuals with the Met allele (the variant form) have been found to have lower COMT activity compared to those with the Val allele (the common form). This difference in COMT activity can influence cognitive function, stress response, and susceptibility to certain mental health conditions.\n\nIn terms of cognitive function, studies have shown that individuals with the Met allele may have an advantage in tasks requiring cognitive flexibility and working memory. However, they may also be more susceptible to stress and anxiety due to the reduced ability to break down catecholamines.\n\nThe COMT V158M variation has also been associated with an increased risk for certain mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, it is important to note that the role of this variation in these conditions is complex and likely involves multiple genetic and environmental factors.\n\nIn conclusion, the COMT V158M variation plays a role in modulating COMT enzyme activity and has implications for cognitive function, stress response, and susceptibility to certain mental health conditions.",

This specific variation has been associated with reduced MTHFR enzyme activity, which means that people with this variation might have higher homocysteine levels.

The C677T mutation is associated with reduced enzyme activity, which can lead to higher levels of homocysteine in the blood.
