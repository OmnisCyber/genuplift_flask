This gene plays a crucial role in regulating the body's response to vitamin D, which is essential for calcium absorption, bone health, and immune system function.The VDR TAQ gene variation has been associated with an increased risk of several diseases, including osteoporosis, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. However, the exact mechanism by which this variation increases disease risk is not fully understood. One possible explanation is that the VDR TAQ gene variation affects the ability of the VDR protein to bind to vitamin D, which could reduce the effectiveness of vitamin D signaling in the body. This could lead to decreased calcium absorption and weakened bones, as well as impaired immune system function.", "effects": ["Vitamin D receptivity"], "diet": ["Make sure you're getting enough calcium in your diet.

On the other hand, the 4R variant is associated with higher levels of the enzyme and lower levels of aggression.\n\nSo, what's the significance of this variation? Well, it can help us understand why some people may be more prone to aggressive behavior or impulsivity, and it could even play a role in the development of certain mental health conditions.
